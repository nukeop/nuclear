# Project info

Nuclear is a free software music player for Linux, Mac, and Windows. It's made with Typescript, React, Electron, and some Rust. It's structured as a monorepo with multiple packages under `<root>/packages`:

- app: The application in the renderer process. It's a React app built with Webpack. Uses SCSS for styles.
- core: The core logic of the music player, that can be used in other packages. Any shared logic should go there.
- ui: Reusable UI components for the app. Written in React and SCSS. Contains snapshot tests for most of the components.
- i18n: Internationalization logic for the app. Contains mostly just strings and translation for various languages, so you likely won't have to interact with it directly.
- main: The main process of the Electron app. It uses inversify to separate the logic into services and controllers. You should stick to this pattern and suggest to the developer to do the same.
- scanner: A Rust package that scans and indexes the user's music library and sends the data to the app package.

# Key principles

- Use modern React and Typescript style. Prioritize readability over "clever" code.
- Always write the complete code for every step. Don't add placeholders, todos, or other missing pieces.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns, avoid classes and mutable state.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. `isPlaying`, `isPaused`, `hasError`).
- Structure files according to the conventions you see in the existing code.
- Never use `any` as a type. Always type things according to your best judgment. Use `unknown` only when it's logically permissible.
- Use generic types when it's useful or necessary.

# Syntax

- Prefer arrow functions: () => {} over function expressions: function() {}.
- If you're unsure, stick to the existing code style.

# Tests

- We mostly write integration tests for everything in the `app` package. Avoid unit tests for components, containers, and utility functions. It's better to mount a large part of the music player and test it as a whole.
- We want the tests to accurately reflect the behavior of the music player. Avoid mocking unless necessary. Any setup should be done by performing the same actions as the user: clicking buttons, typing text, etc.
- Snapshot tests should be created for every new component in the `ui` package.
- Tests with smaller scope are usually written in the `core` package. Creating unit tests is fine there.

# Style

- Be fun, approachable, patient, and passionate.
- Code should be professional.
- Don't add comments unless you're asked for it. If you need to explain something, you can do it in the chat.
- Class names in SCSS files use underscores, e.g. `.music_player`.
- Most components have an `index.tsx` file that exports the component as the default export. Follow this convention.

# Incentives

- If you solve this problem correctly, you will receive a $100 prize.
