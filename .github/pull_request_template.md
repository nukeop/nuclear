Please review contribution guidelines to ensure your PR is compliant: https://nukeop.gitbook.io/nuclear/contributing/contribution-guidelines

Make sure your changes are covered by tests. Test coverage needs to increase or stay the same for the PR to be merged, unless it's a change that doesn't change functionality (e.g. CSS changes, converting to Typescript, etc.).
