## What is this?
nuclear is a free music streaming program that pulls content from free sources all over the internet.

If you know [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube), this is a similar music player but with a GUI.
It's also focusing more on audio. Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.

## Pre-alpha release
The current version is a pre-alpha early access. Some of it is usable, some of it isn't. If there are things that don't work as expected or are counterintuitive, please open an issue so I can prioritize working on them.

## What if I am religiously opposed to Electron?
See [this](docs/electron.md).

## Development process
You will need docker and docker-compose.
As all Electron applications, Nuclear has two parts: the server and the web app. Both are containerized. You need to allow the root user to connect to X11 display, and then you can run docker-compose:

```shell
$ xhost SI:localuser:root
$ sudo docker-compose up dev
```

A new window should open that will load the web app and run Nuclear.
On non-Linux systems, you can use lerna:
```shell
$ npm i -g lerna #installs lerna globally
$ lerna bootstrap
$ lerna run start
```

---
To build for current operating system:
```bash
$ npm run build
```

Instead of `build` you can use `build:all` to build for all operating systems. The binaries will be in `packages/app/release`

In case of errors with dbus/mpris, try removing optional dependencies from `packages/app/package.json` and node_modules.
