## What is this?
nuclear is a free music streaming program that pulls content from free sources all over the internet.

If you know [mps-youtube](https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube), this is a similar music player but with a GUI.
It's also focusing more on audio. Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.

## Pre-alpha release
The current version is a pre-alpha early access. Some of it is usable, some of it isn't. If there are things that don't work as expected or are counterintuitive, please open an issue so I can prioritize working on them.

## What if I am religiously opposed to Electron?
See [this](docs/electron.md).

## Dev build process
As all Electron applications, Nuclear has two parts: the server and the web app.

Before you begin, make sure you're using the latest version of Node and NPM. 
To run the web app part in development mode locally, you should only do:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
```

This launches webpack. It watches local files for changes and rebuilds the project as needed. The project also has hot reload built in. 

To launch the server, you need to run this in another terminal window:
```bash
$ npm run electron:dev
```
This launches a development version of the program. Tmux is very useful here so you can keep an eye on all running processes.

A new window should open that will load the web app part and run Nuclear.

---
To run production version:

```bash
$ npm run build:dist
$ npm run electron:prod
```
---
To build for current operating system:
```bash
$ npm run build:dist
$ npm run build:electron
$ npm run pack
```

Instead of `pack` you can use `build:all` to build for all operating systems or `build:[system]` to build for a particular system (see package.json).

In case of errors with dbus/mpris, try removing optional dependencies from package.json and node_modules.
